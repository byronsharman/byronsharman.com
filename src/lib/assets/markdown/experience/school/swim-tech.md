I spent the summer of 2025 working with two other students to build a voice categorization tool for Swim Tech, a swimming instruction company based in Colorado. Our project was essentially a microservice that converts voice recordings to text, recognizes names, and matches them to student records. During this time, I
- Translated our client's business requirements into technical specifications.
- Helped ideate a serverless architecture in **AWS** involving services like
  Lambda, S3, API Gateway, Transcribe, Cognito, etc.
- Implemented that architecture with OpenTofu (an open-source fork of
  **Terraform**), enabling reproducibility, managing infrastructure with version
  control, and per-environment experimentation 
- Wrote a **CI/CD pipeline** that provisioned our infrastructure and rendered a
  static demo site which interfaced with our API.
