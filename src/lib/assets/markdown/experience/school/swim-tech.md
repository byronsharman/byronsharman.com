I spent the summer of 2025 building a voice categorization tool for SwimÂ Tech,
a swimming instruction company based in Colorado. During this time, I
- Designed a serverless architecture in **AWS** estimated to cost roughly
  1/10th of equivalent traditional compute options
- Provisioned cloud resources with OpenTofu (an open-source fork of
  **Terraform**), managing all **infrastructure as code** for better
  reproducibility and a seamless client hand-off
- Bridged business and engineering domains by translating stakeholder
  requirements into technical specifications
- Wrote a **CI/CD pipeline** that applies infrastructure changes, renders a
  static site, and deploys the app, saving hours of tedious manual deployment and
  facilitating feature delivery
