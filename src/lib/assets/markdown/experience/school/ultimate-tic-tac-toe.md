[Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe) is a
variant of the popular game that nests another tic-tac-toe board inside each
square. I implemented a text-based version for my final project in
CSCI&nbsp;200. All the game logic and rule-checking is implemented, and the
board itself is stored in a
[`std::bitset`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/bitset), a choice I
made to challenge myself with some bitwise logic.
