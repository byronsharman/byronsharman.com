StandUp is an app that encourages office workers to take brief exercise breaks
by allowing them to post a picture of their workout afterward. It marked my
first endeavor into the JavaScript soup that is modern frontend development. My
biggest contribution was creating the UI that live-previews a webcam and takes
a photo, which wasn't as easy as one would have thought.
