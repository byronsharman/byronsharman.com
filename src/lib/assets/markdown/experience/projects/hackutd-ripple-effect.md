Spontani is a web app for sharing nearby destinations, ideal for the
spontaneous adventurer. Users can share destinations and upload pictures of
their travels there. Working on the frontend, which is written in Svelte and
styled with Tailwind, I designed and built many of the pages of the final user
interface.
