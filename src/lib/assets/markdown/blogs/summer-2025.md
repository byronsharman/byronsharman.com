This semester has been very busy, which has made me think of the last time I
wasn't busy: this summer, when most of my days were spent strolling under the
giant maple trees in Kafadar Commons. I've since reflected that this was likely
the last summer off I'll have until I retire, so maybe it's worth writing
about.

## Field session

Field session, or Advanced Software Engineering, is a special class in Mines's
computer science curriculum which pairs teams of students with engineering
projects proposed by companies and individuals. Students can either choose the
teammates they work with or the project they'll develop. Based on advice from
students who had previously taken the class, I decided to build a team,
reasoning that a good team would be critical regardless of the project, and a
bad team would be worse than a bad project. So I chose [Grant
Lemons](https://grantlemons.com/) and [Nathan
George](https://www.whimsicalcode.com/), two friends who proved to be talented,
hardworking, and fun to spend time with.

Summer field session is very different from other classes because it's only 5
weeks long, but a time commitment of 40 hours per week is expected. I greatly
enjoyed this format because it allowed me to treat school more like a full-time
job. When I came home, I was done with work. None of the working-after-dinner
nonsense of a regular semester!

The class improved my technical skills significantly. Our entire project lived
in AWS, and I had to think about how to factor the processing pipeline into
pieces and translate each piece into a cloud resource provisioned with
OpenTofu, our infrastructure as code tool. Grant recommended the IaC route, and
it was an excellent choice because it allowed each team member to experiment
with their own instance of the architecture, and since many more lines of code
were dedicated to infrastructure than actual business logic, our velocity
significantly improved. For the same reason, the ability to track our
infrastructure changes under version control proved crucial to our development
process. Finally, this choice allowed us to transition from our personal cloud
accounts to our client's account very easily.

Though I've dabbled with Nix for a while, this was really my first time fully
embracing a declarative configuration, and I grew to appreciate the power and
convenience that comes with it. Additionally, writing our CI/CD pipeline helped
me understand DevOps a lot better and realize why deployment strategy is
something to which companies dedicate entire teams.

For both reports and presentation slides throughout the class, we used
[Typst](https://typst.app/) to typeset and generate PDFs programatically. We
greatly appreciated its speed, language design, and ease of use. I have since
adopted Typst both for other classes and for personal use. I highly recommend
it. Frequently it gives me what I call the _Vim feeling_: it's so powerful that
it feels unfair, as if I shouldn't have been allowed to do that complicated
20-minute task in 15 seconds with two lines of code. Besides, the near-instant
compilation times and the fact that it is a full programming language makes it
a clear winner over LaTeX. I'm excited to continue using it throughout my
career.

Our client, [Swim Tech](https://swimtechsport.com/), was pleased with our work.
All the teams had a final presentation, and we practiced ours extensively. This
effort earned us a students' choice award for Best Technical Presentation!

## Fourteeners

I climbed my first three fourteeners this summer: Grays Peak, Torries Peak, and
Mount Bierstadt. Though I've lived in Colorado my entire life, my time in the
mountains has previously been limited to high mountain lakes or scenic trails
not involving a summit. I went to the mountains to be alone with my thoughts in
nature. However, my roommate, Jose, has been getting into fourteeners and was
gracious enough to invite me. I found them to be a fun way to experience the
mountains, albeit for completely different reasons than I am accustomed to.
Climbing a fourteener is a social event; everyone faces the same challenge and
encourages each other to surmount it. That said, the three mountains I summited
are probably the three most crowded in Colorado, so I don't know what the
experience is like at lower-traffic mountains.

Overall, I enjoyed trying this new form of getting outdoors, but I think I
prefer the other way better. There's nothing quite like finding a remote lake
and being all alone with a friend or family member for the weekend.

## Chasing hobbies

Field Session ended pretty early, and my only other commitment was TAing for
Data Structures and Algorithms, so I had plenty of time. Ever since being
emancipated from Mines's meal plan, I've been keen to learn how to cook, and
this summer afforded me a great opportunity to hone my skills. I iterated on
recipes for grilled cheese, mac and cheese, stir fries, hashed browns, beef
stew, steak, spaghetti, etc., etc. I was surprised by the extent to which
techniques of starkly different dishes overlap. An understanding of heat and
seasoning applies universally. I am now at a level where I can make some dishes
well and others OK, and I can improvise something reasonably tasty with
whatever is in the fridge and pantry, which was one of my main goals when I
started. Considering I have only been cooking in earnest for a year, I am quite
content with this progress. It's really satisfying to make something delicious!
The only downside is that I have gone from being willing to eat anything to
being fairly picky because I critique my own food critically. Next, I hope to
broaden my repertoire and cuisine familiarity.

Ever since my first week at Mines, I've been struggling to balance piano with
everything else I want to do in college. I love playing the piano, but I don't
have the time to get good at it or the capital to afford an instructor.
However, the first constraint no longer applied during the summer, and I really
enjoyed learning some new pieces and listening to repertoire with which I was
not previously familiar. I've been following [Ben
Laude](https://www.youtube.com/@benlawdy)'s Chopin podcast as well as letting
YouTube recommend obscure yet highly underrated works by Liszt and others. I'm
listening to the infamously massive Busoni Piano Concerto as I write this.

I spent a lot of time [refreshing my
website](https://byronsharman.com/blog/website-takeaways), but I already
blogged about that, so I won't elaborate here. Suffice it to say that I did a
much better job of improving my software engineering skills this summer than
the last, and I made sure there was plenty of green on my GitHub profile.

## Summary

Aside from the activities described above, I spent a lot of time traveling with
and to family, seeing friends from high school, and attending various events.
All of these made for a quite enjoyable few months. It's quite a while until
next summer, so it remains to be seen what that one will be like. For now, it's
time to focus on school!
