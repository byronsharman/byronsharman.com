description: I've rediscovered an old good habit.
---

In the Christmas of 2024, I was surprised to unwrap some presents
to reveal good old-fashioned paper-filled books. I started reading
them every day and found myself thoroughly enjoying them. "Reading
books is a cool hobby," I said to myself. "If only it were free!"
Then I remembered that there is [a public
library](https://jeffcolibrary.org/locations/gn/) within walking
distance of the Mines campus. I didn't read quite as much as I'd
have liked—and I certainly didn't finish as many books as I started—but
I _did_ find a way to wind down before going to bed that's much
healthier than doomscrolling. So, mostly for myself, but maybe to
the benefit of some of my readers, I'm going to list them, in
order of most enjoyable to least enjoyable.

## Books I finished, from best to worst

### _A Gentleman in Moscow_ by Amor Towles
This is the best book I've read since _Les Misérables_ in
8th grade. In fact, it's among the best I've read, ever. Uniquely,
it takes place over some forty years of the protagonist's life,
and it does so extremely well. Little recurring themes, scenes
here and there, all point to this theme. When I finished, I kept
thinking about the whole story, nostalgic for years past that I'd
read about only days ago.

Additionally, the protagonist is incredibly likeable and
relatable, and finds himself living in a metaphorical microcosm
for most of the book. Oh, and a Rachmaninoff piece is heavily
featured. I adore Rachmaninoff.

If you only look into one book from this list, read this one. It
has earned my highest recommendation.

### _I'm Starting to Worry About This Black Box of Doom_ by Jason Pargin
Finally, a book about real-life problems that doesn't take place
180 years ago. Enjoy a delightful character-driven adventure
involving Reddit, influencers, cryptocurrencies, furry hentai
artists, and the great cesspit of internet culture. Great fun, but
not without meaning. I'm glad I own this; I expect to find myself
reading it again.

### _The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs_ by Steve Brusatte
The book earns its readers' attention with caricatures of
legendary paleontologists and stories of their fossil discoveries
before going into the science of what made that animal
interesting.

Brusatte does a good job emphasizing that dinosaurs were not the
monsters we see in movies but rather well-adapted animals that ate
and lived and reproduced just like modern ones. Overall, this was
a fun read, and I learned a lot. My sole complaint is that
sometimes facts are over-sensationalized. I don't know how many
times I had to read that _T. rex_'s teeth were the size of
bananas. That said, it's not as egregious as pop science shows can
be.

### _Angela's Ashes_ by Frank McCourt
An autobiography of someone with a rather traumatic childhood,
_Angela's Ashes_ preserves the story of a unique culture at a
unique time. The style is excellent; it's well-written, draining,
or humorous whenever it should be. The book has a bit of a Ralph
Moody-esque vibe to it, but a little darker. It was good for me to
think about what it might be like to grow up in an environment so
unlike the one in which I was raised. I was a little puzzled by
the ending, as it seemed to be strictly narrative when it had the
opportunity to be more than that. Overall, I'd still consider it
one of the better works I read this year.

### _The Midnight Library_ by Matt Haig
I heard about this book from [Elijah's blog
post](https://elijahpotter.dev/articles/the-books-i-read-in-january-2025)
and thought I'd try it. I'm glad I did. It's a little bit
predictable, but not in a bad way. It had a great message and
vivid imagery. My biggest problem was that Haig's prose is
adequate but not memorable. I don't get the "master at work"
feeling that I do with Mark Twain or E. B. White. If this book is
what you're looking for, give it a try!

### _The Tale of Despereaux_ by Kate DiCamillo
I liked this one as a child. I remember when I was a kid I was
sick in bed for a weekend and read this over and over. It's still
a great classic, but I'm too old for it now. I only read it
because I was waiting for something else to arrive at the library.

### _The Children of Men_ by P. D. James
I watched the movie first, and I think the movie was significantly
better. The two are very different. Making myself finish this made
me feel like I was reading _Brave New World_ for high school
English all over again. The same style, the same issue:
storytelling is used as a device to illustrate the thesis rather
than being recognized as an essential part of an art form, worthy
for its own sake. This is the typical pitfall of speculative
fiction. Go watch the movie instead. Do note that part of what
makes the movie good is the intensity of not knowing the ending,
so it's best to go in without any research. Just know that it's
neither happy nor light.

## Books I started but didn't finish, from best to worst

### _Being Mortal_ by Atul Gawande
This one was recommended to me by a friend. I think it was quite
good, but it had the misfortune of being checked out at the same
time as Brusatte's dinosaur book, so it didn't have much chance in
the competition for my attention.

### _The Complete Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley_
After reading "Ozymandias" in middle school and again in high
school, Shelley's name became memorable to me. Many of the books I
tried fell short of my goal of improving my own English. Shelley
most certainly compensates in this area. Sometimes when listening
to classical music I feel very connected to the music itself. It
need not imitate an army or a pair of lovers or a sermon on a
rainy Sunday afternoon; it is music itself, and therefore
intrinsically beautiful. I've never felt this in English until I
read "Alastor; or, The Spirit of Solitude". A more correct enjoyer
of poetry than I would hesitate to rip lines out of their context,
but for the sake of my blog I reproduce this favorite excerpt:

<blockquote>
  Hither the Poet came. His eyes beheld<br />
  Their own wan light through the reflected lines<br />
  Of his thin hair, distinct in the dark depth<br />
  Of that still fountain; as the human heart,<br />
  Gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave,<br />
  Sees its own treacherous likeness there…
</blockquote>

My library's edition included prefaces written by Shelley's wife,
Mary Shelley, also an excellent commander of English. I enjoyed
reading those poems which my attention span allowed me to read.

### _Technofeudalism_ by Yanis Varoufakis
Varoufakis's thesis widely resonates in the online circles I
frequent, though I don't understand it much myself. I think it's
very important that I know how to think independently; I've seen
what happens when people can't do that. What better way to open
the mind than to learn more about a viewpoint with which I was
previously unfamiliar? I agreed with a lot of the book, but I felt
like I pretty much got it when I was about halfway through.

I guess I haven't thought about it enough to state much here. I
noticed some points where lack of technical knowledge seemed to
lead to shaky conclusions. However, I must concede Yanis seems
quite prescient when considering recent outages in AWS and
Cloudflare. It's dangerous to build almost all our infrastructure
upon the products of an oligopoly.

More generally, it's alarming that politicians seem to have no
trouble ceding control to large private organizations. This I
believe to be a product of multiple issues, the most notable of
which is that non-technical politicians making policies about
technology are inherently uninformed.

### _Deep Work_ by Cal Newport
The thesis is wonderful; the writing is not. I don't know what it
is about this tone, but it drives me crazy. I tolerated a few
chapters before deciding that deep work is good, I suck at
making it a habit, and reading another 200 pages is unlikely to
change that.

For one of my high school English classes, I had to write a
research paper. I procrastinated until the last couple of days and
turned in a product I wasn't proud of. When I confessed this to my
teacher, lamenting the fact that this was not my first time making
this mistake, he replied, "Would that we could all learn a lesson
at the first opportunity!" I think deep work is like that. I'll
need another four or five lessons before much happens.

### _The End of Craving: Recovering the Lost Wisdom of Eating Well_ by Mark Schatzker
This title came on my radar after I commented to someone about how
scientific experiments don't work very well in the medicine field
because there are so many confounding variables. I don't think it
was written to answer that concern. Instead, it was the ramblings
of some guy who did a lot of Googling about food and decided to
write it in the most annoying style I have ever endured. Anecdote
after anecdote clearly written for someone with no attention span
(admittedly, I guess that makes me the target audience) but
somehow dry nevertheless. Part of the reason I'm reading books is
to improve my language skills. That means I need to read books
written by someone better at writing than me. Perhaps Schatzker
has mastered the act of regurgitating the self-help best-seller
formula, but he's no Dickens when it comes to his prose.

## Conclusion

I'm glad I rediscovered the hobby of reading this year. Despite
being the cheapest of all my hobbies, costing an accumulated $0 at
the time of writing, it has a lot to offer. It makes me smarter,
improves my communication skills, teaches me something new, and
exposes me to novel ideas (ha ha). It's also quite a bit healthier
than alternatives. Hopefully I will find myself continuing to read
for the rest of my life. If you used to read but haven't picked up
a book in a while, I'd encourage you to try it again!
