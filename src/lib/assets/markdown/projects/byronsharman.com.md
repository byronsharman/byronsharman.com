My website does a lot of things, but they can all be simplified as using
Javascript to turn JSON, images, and Markdown into a static site made of HTML
and CSS. Almost all the content of the site is generated from metadata. I
use the excellent [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework to accomplish this.
