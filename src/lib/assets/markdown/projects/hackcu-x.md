Multinotes is a note-taking website streamlined for multimedia organization and
deeply integrated with a vector database for AI searchability. I worked on the
window manager that displays objects on the whiteboard, as well as helping save
and load whiteboards from API calls.

Like all hackathon projects, Multinotes was a collaborative effort created in
24â€“36 hours.
