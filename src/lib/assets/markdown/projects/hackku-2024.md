Kioku is a web application that slows brain regression induced by dementia.
Users can stimulate their mental skills by playing customizable matching,
flashcard, and puzzle games. I designed all the UI elements and spearheaded much of the frontend development.

Like all hackathon projects, Kioku was a collaborative effort created in
24â€“36 hours.
