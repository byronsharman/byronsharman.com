Pear allows multiple people to simultaneously access and use a terminal in real
time. Users are connected via [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/); since stdin and
stdout are streams, they can simply be copied over the network. I mostly worked
on figuring out how to connect multiple nodes with libp2p. The whole project is
written in Go.
