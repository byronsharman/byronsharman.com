I am one of many drawn to the simplicity of Sushi Go, a card game easily
learned but remarkably strategic. I resolved to make an electronic version,
starting by implementing the scoring and gameplay logic. That paved the way for
adding a computer engine, making a pretty frontend, and introducing multiplayer
support, although currently I'm only working on the first of those.
